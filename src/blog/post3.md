Let me start off by saying this. 

**__3D Printing is addictive__**

I initially started my 3D Printing journey back in 2017, when the landscape for 3D Printing was very much in its infancy. I found a 3D Printer on Amazon (I can't even remember the name of it now) but it had a tiny bed and it took 12+ hours to print a benchy but even still I was hooked. Unfortunately due to me being a complete noob to the hobby and the technology just not being as mature as it is today, I stopped using my printer. I ran in to leveling issues constantly, spaghetti prints and blockages and it was disheartening so I decided to step back for a bit. 

Then Covid happened...

Being bored, stuck in the house I decided to look at the market and see where things were moving and I came across the [Bambu Labs](https://bambulab.com) and it looked like all my prayers were answered. The claimed to offer "plug and play" levels of 3D Printing with their [X1C printer](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon?id=579541357241671687&skr=yes&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21217723580&gbraid=0AAAAAo9so7NYRtQ5m6hhgL7gy5XrVIiLw&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI29C64-u0jQMV25taBR2EdAE_EAQYASABEgJXbfD_BwE). Automatic bed leveling, LIDAR scanning for imperfections, multi-colored prints and lots more. So I bought one... and it reignited my interest in the hobby. I start printing the most random things that I could find online

But then something hits you, you start to realize that you have more things to print than your single printer can handle if you want them done in any sort of reasonable time... To Bambus credit, the X1C is a very fast printer but I guess I got greedy because I ended up buying 2 more printers...

Enter the [Elegoo Neptune 4 Max](https://us.elegoo.com/products/neptune-4-max-fdm-3d-printer?srsltid=AfmBOorKv831vCyT3Z84VIfwuKcE8eL7EBJJa0skD7IKCnI4Edim5La3)

This printer is has a 420x420x480mm printing bed which makes it almost double the capacity of my X1C. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles but it helped me with one major thing and that was not having to cut my pieces up in to bits and piece them together with glue or a soldering iron. I ended up with 2 of these to deal with a big project I had coming up and they were my workhorses for quite a while but the build speed with them was not the best so I considered picking myself up another X1C for speed until all of the nonsense about closing down their ecosystem and locking features behind online functionality I decided to look elsewhere. Which is when I came across the K1 Max.

The K1 Max is Crealitys answer to the X1C and at a third of the price. This printer has all the same functionality, minus the AMS and it is now my favorite go-to printer. I use it for everything. 

The last piece of the puzzle was my resin printer.. I recently got in to minature model painting (Warhammer 40K) and decided I wanted to be able to print my own models and paint them. Here is a look at one of my first attempts

Overall it's been a great experience. There has definitely been a lot of learning involved and the curve can be steep at times but it's been worth it. 

I've printed all sorts of things

- Movie Props
- Masks
- Helmets
- Minatures
- Toilet Roll holder with a ledge...

I eventually want to work on a large project. I've been considering doing something like a lifesize R2D2 from Star Wars... Maybe I can talk about it here some time.
