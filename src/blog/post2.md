# “It Looked Fine Until It Wasn’t” - The Hidden Costs of Relying on AI Code Generation

As a software developer, you’re probably already using AI to help write code. It speeds up boilerplate, gives you starting points, and even answers questions when you’re stuck. But if you’ve ever dropped AI-generated code into your project and thought, *“This’ll do for now”* you’re not alone.  

And that’s the problem.

While AI code generation feels like magic, it introduces real risks that we, as developers, can’t afford to ignore. Here’s what we’re seeing—and feeling—on the ground.



## 1. It Works Until You Read It Closely

AI-generated code often compiles. It even passes your tests. But then you step back and actually *read* it and realize you don’t quite understand what it’s doing. Or worse, it’s doing something subtly wrong.

In a recent sprint, I asked AI for a utility to sanitize user input. It returned something that looked correct—but skipped a key edge case involving special characters. It made it to staging. We caught it in QA. Barely.

That’s the core issue: AI code can look fine, but lack deep correctness. It doesn’t *understand* your business logic, your data model, or your architecture.



## 2. It’s Not Just About Bugs—It’s About Accountability

When a human developer writes code, there’s always a **trail of intent**. Even if the code isn’t perfect, there’s usually a reason behind it, some tradeoff, some constraint, some specific goal. If something breaks, you can ask: *Why was this done this way?* You can tap a teammate on the shoulder, file a pull request comment, or dig into commit messages for clues. There’s a clear line between the author and their decision.

With AI, that trail disappears.

There is no author. There’s no architectural vision, no long-term context, no awareness of team dynamics or product goals. You can’t ask a language model why it chose a particular pattern or made a certain tradeoff. You just get output. And if that code ends up in production, no matter how it got there—the accountability shifts to *you*, the person who pasted it in. Even if you didn’t fully understand it. Even if it wasn’t your logic.

In many engineering teams today, developers are already shipping code they didn’t fully vet. Not out of negligence, but out of **necessity**. Tight deadlines. Constant context switching. Burnout. The pressure to keep up with product roadmaps or stakeholder expectations. AI makes it easy to appear productive, pull in a snippet, fill in a few variables and move on. But that speed comes at a cost.

The cost is **technical debt**, but not the kind that’s obvious in a code review. It’s more subtle: logic that nobody fully understands, edge cases no one anticipated, architectures that quietly diverge from team standards. And because the original “author” doesn’t exist, the debugging process later becomes slower, murkier, and more frustrating.

This kind of debt is insidious. It slips into the codebase under the radar. It bypasses collective code ownership. And over time, it makes your system harder to maintain, harder to onboard into, and harder to trust.

Using AI to assist coding isn’t the problem, **using it without accountability is**. When speed takes priority over understanding, and when no one owns the consequences, we end up building systems that no one can explain or safely evolve.


## 3. AI Is a Terrible Mentor

Junior developers are especially vulnerable in this new AI-assisted development era. For many, the path into programming is already steep learning syntax, tools, workflows, and design patterns, often without structured support. In that environment, AI can feel like a godsend: it answers questions instantly, writes code on command, and fills in gaps that would otherwise take hours to Google or understand.

But AI is a **terrible teacher**.

It doesn’t explain trade-offs. It doesn’t help you weigh options or understand *why* one approach might be better than another in a given context. It doesn't pause to ask what you're trying to learn. It just gives you answers confidently and without nuance. And because the output *looks* right, it's easy to trust without questioning.

What gets lost in that process is **thinking**.

New developers gradually shift from “learning how to solve problems” to “learning how to prompt better.” The hard, slow work of building mental models debugging, tracing logic and refactoring is replaced by fast and shallow iteration. And when things break (as they inevitably do), many lack the tools to understand *why* or how to fix it.

Over time, this leads to a worrying outcome: developers who can **write apps**, but can’t **debug them**. They can produce code, scaffold features, and even ship products but their understanding is skin-deep. Ask them to track down a memory leak, resolve a race condition, or untangle an obscure bug in a legacy service, and they’re lost.

This isn’t their fault. It’s the result of putting a production tool in the hands of learners without guardrails, guidance, or mentorship. AI makes it easier to appear skilled while skipping over the slow, essential steps that actually build skill.

If we want to support junior developers in an AI-native world, we need to **rethink how learning happens**. We can’t rely on AI to teach judgment, reasoning, or engineering instincts. That still requires humans: mentorship, code reviews, pairing sessions, and a culture that values *understanding* over *output*.

Otherwise, we risk raising a generation of developers who can build anything until something breaks.




## 4. Stack Overflow Made Us Smarter. AI Can Make Us Passive.

With Stack Overflow, the process of solving a problem is inherently active. You have to formulate a clear question, search through various answers, read through threads of comments, and often evaluate competing solutions. Even then, the "accepted answer" might not apply directly to your situation. It is common to tweak code snippets, understand edge cases, and cross-reference documentation. This friction—although sometimes frustrating, is productive. It forces developers to think critically, understand the *why* behind the solution and, in doing so, sharpen their problem solving skills.

With AI, the experience is fundamentally different. You type a prompt, and it hands you a solution, syntactically correct, cleanly formatted, and, more often than not, *plausible*. It feels right. But the very convenience that makes AI so appealing can also be its biggest danger. There's no natural friction. No debate, no divergent opinions, no peer review. Just a confident answer.

This shift from active searching to passive accepting may seem like a minor UX upgrade, but it subtly undermines one of the most important muscles a developer builds: the habit of asking, *“Is this actually a good solution?”* When that instinct atrophies, developers risk becoming overly reliant on the tool, accepting code without understanding its assumptions, limitations, or context.

In a world where AI feels like an all knowing mentor, the temptation to skip the thinking step is strong. But the consequences—security flaws, poor performance, brittle code, will be ours to own.




## 5. Context Is Everything—And AI Has None

We don’t write code in isolation, we write it in **ecosystems**. Our systems are built atop years of architectural decisions, third-party integrations, tech debt, internal tooling, and team conventions. Most large applications aren’t greenfield projects with clean boundaries; they’re living, breathing organisms. There are microservices with subtle coupling, asynchronous data flows, domain specific quirks, and legacy modules that only one engineer truly understands. These are the contexts that shape what “good code” really looks like in practice.

AI doesn’t see any of that.

It doesn’t know how your team handles dependency injection. It’s unaware of that function you can’t refactor because it’s tied to a weird edge case in an old partner integration. It doesn’t understand the internal naming conventions you follow to distinguish between user-facing services and backend workers. It won’t catch that subtle performance issue that only happens under high load on production hardware or that workaround your team had to implement for a flaky third-party API that misbehaves 5% of the time.

What this means is that even **well structured, correct looking code** from an LLM often needs **heavy adaptation** to fit your actual system. It may be idiomatic, but not idiomatic *for you*. It may perform well in benchmarks, but not in your production environment. It may be secure in general, but not under the constraints you’re working with.

And when developers blindly drop AI-generated code into systems like this without understanding the implications, it creates **fragility**. It may compile. It may even pass tests. But it also risks introducing silent bugs, performance regressions, or integration mismatches that take hours (or days) to trace later.

In the end, using AI as a helper is powerful. But using it uncritically, as if it understands your ecosystem, is a fast track to accumulating invisible complexity.




## So, What Should We Do About It?

AI is here. It’s not going away. And when used *well*, it’s genuinely helpful.

But we need to stop pretending it’s a shortcut to real software engineering. It’s not. It’s just a faster way to get from “blank file” to “first draft.” The rest is still on us.

Here’s what we can do:

- **Treat AI like a junior pair programmer. Helpful, but needs oversight.**
- **Read everything it gives you like it came from an intern.**
- **Write tests. Especially when AI wrote the function.**
- **Encourage real code review—don’t just rubber stamp AI PRs.**
- **Teach junior devs *why* something works, not just what to paste.**



## Final Thoughts

The promise of AI in software development isn’t just about **speed**, it’s about **amplifying human creativity and insight**. The best case scenario is one where AI handles the boilerplate, suggests patterns, and helps us explore ideas faster than ever before. It's a powerful tool, perhaps the most powerful many of us have ever had.

But tools don’t make decisions. **We do**.

If we use AI to **replace our thinking** instead of **augmenting it**, we risk becoming **spectators to our own codebases**. We stop understanding the systems we’re building. We become implementers of machine generated logic rather than authors of thoughtful, maintainable software. And when that happens, we lose what makes this work meaningful: our ability to reason, to design, to question and to improve.

Writing software has always been more than just producing code, it’s about solving problems, navigating ambiguity, and shaping systems that reflect human values, constraints, and goals. AI can assist with that, but only if *we* remain engaged as the final arbiters of quality, clarity, and intent.

As developers, we owe it to ourselves and to our future teammates to stay sharp, stay curious, and always question the code. **Even when it comes from a machine**. Especially when it comes from a machine.

Because in the long run, **thinking is still our most important skill**. And the best developers will be the ones who treat AI not as a crutch, but as a collaborator, never letting it dull their judgment, and always insisting on understanding before shipping.
